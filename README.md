# tic-tac-toe
This repository contains a basic implementation of the tic-tac-toe game in the programming language of your choice. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and players take turns placing their symbols (usually X's and O's) on the grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
